# FORTH ENGINES

# dictionary

the dictionary is a linked list of (link, size + flags, name, pad, (code or references))

Example of dictionary structure (adapted from jonasforth.S)

```
defword:  ; one reference DOCOL to all compound words, 
                                           (..........all cells are references.........)

Some comparations of implementations of Forth.
All use concepts as next, nest aka docolon, unnest aka semmis and exit.

# 1. eForth for Cortex M4

Dr. C.H.Ting take a optimal approach for forth engine, for a ESP32, using cpu family specific instructions (ISA) *inline into dictionary* 
<http://forth.org/OffeteStore/1013_eForthAndZen.pdf>

Cortex M4 is a Harvard CPU, have do unified memory model, could have 512k flash and 96k sram,.

### ; the inner interpreter, in macro code:
```
_next:    BX LR                 ; branch to ptr in LR, (exchange PC and LR, inc LR, inc LR, jmp PC)
_nest:    STMFD R2!, {LR}       ; push LR into return stack
_unnest:  LDMFD R2!, {PC}       ; pull PC from return stack
_exec:    BL ptr                ; branch and link, ( mov ptr to LR, inc LR, inc LR, jmp ptr)
```
### ; the dictionary, PFA:

```
leaf ==> instr, instr, instr, instr, _next
    
twig ==> _nest, BL ptr, BL ptr, BL ptr, _unest         
```
### ; considerations

> high (most) efficient code;

> all dicionary is CPU dependent;

> all compond words have a payload per reference;

> the memory model is unified, flash and sram are continuous address;

### ; notes

>the instruction BL accepts +/- 32 Mb offset, then dictionary must be less than 32 MB, but using 4 bytes per word, it is about 8M words, with 2 words per reference, then almost 4M for use, still a lot of free address space.

_in my opinion, is the best and ideal solution per cpu, at cost of size and portability_

*Impossible to use, this implementation uses far more memory than a Atmega8 have.*

# 2. In flashforth, <https://flashforth.com/index.html>, for avr uCs with at least 32k flash

    interleaves rcall and rjmp inside dictionary; 
    all dicionary is CPU dependent;
    all twig words have a payload as first and last references;
    all leaf words have a payload as self reference and last jump;
    Can not run into a Atmega8 with 8k flash.

# 3. In amforth for AVR family, <https://github.com/lowfatcomputing/amforth-all/> <http://amforth.sourceforge.net/>  

"AmForth is an interactive 16-bit Forth for Atmel ATmega microcontrollers.
It does not need additional hard or software. It works completely on
the controller (no cross-compiler)."

"Amforth is influenced by (early versions of) avrforth"

The interpreter code as excerpt from version 6.9, 18/10/2020, Matthias Trute, Erich WÃ¤lde et alli.

```asm
; XH:XL is Instruction pointer, 
; ZH:ZL is program memory pointer, 
; WH:WL is working register, 
; Tmp1:Tmp0 is a scratch temporary

DO_COLON: ; 8
      push XL
      push XH
      movw XL, WL
      adiw XL, 1

DO_NEXT:  ; 12
      movw ZL, XL
      lsl ZL
      rol ZH
      lpm WL, Z+
      lpm WH, Z+
      adiw XL, 1
      
DO_EXECUTE:   ; 14
      movw ZL, WL
      lsl ZL
      rol ZH
      lpm Tmp0, Z+
      lpm Tmp1, Z+
      movw ZL, Tmp0
      ijmp 

DO_EXIT:  ; 6
      pop XH
      pop XL
      rjmp DO_NEXT
```
; the dicionary, inside PFA

- leaf ==>  (ptr of code0), code0, code ... , (rjmp DO_NEXT)
    
- twig ==>  (ptr of DO_COLON), ptr ... ptr, (ptr of DO_EXIT)

### ; considerations

> traditional and efficient code;

> twig dictionary is CPU independent;

> all twig words have a payload as first and last references (DO_COL and DO_EXIT);

> all leaf words have a payload as first reference (to self) and last jump;

> the memory model is not unified, separate address for flash, sdram.

> why two "adiw WL, 1" ? Adjust Z to a even address

# 4. In this F2U implementation for ATMEGA8, 
  
All primitive words use a branch and link model, with next reference explicity keeped into a reserved register to later return.

All compound words use a call and return model, with next reference pushed into and pulled from the return stack.

Not using Atmega8 instructions call, return, pop and push.

This inner interpreters only works for program memory (flash), due specific address flash memory squema for AVRs using lpm 

```

## Why branch and link ? 

This really saves stack depth and reduce overall instruction code size by simplifly some primitives.

A good essay, by David Frech, at <https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/call-versus-branch-and-link/>, asserts "There is a jump involved, so perhaps a pipeline refill occurs.", but always will have a jump.
## the dictionary

I like use the terms leaf for primitives words and twig for compound words, as in <https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/threaded-code/>.
  
    ;------------- independent 
    
    twig ==>  ref, ..., leaf, ... , ref, _ends
    
    leaf ==>  0x00, (ptr)
    
    ;-------------- dependent
    
    ; table trampolim
    (rjmp ref), (rjmp ref) ....
    
    ; inner interpreter
    (_void) (0x00), _exit, _next, _enter, _branch, _link,
    
    ; code for primitives
    (ptr) code ... code (rjmp _link)

### ; considerations

    efficient code as cost of speed;
    twigs are dicionary is CPU independent;
    all twig words have only a payload at last references;
    all leaf words have a payload by starts with NULL and ends with a jump;

    leaf (could) do references to trampolim table, with real references of primitives;

### Codes and Parameters
